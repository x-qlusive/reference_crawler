This project started during my bachelor thesis for the FH Joanneum.

It was created to gather data according to S-BPM conference puplications

The Crawlers are intended to collect data from the authors and their references according to specific S-BPM conferences.

The SpringerCrawler collects the data from SpringerLink and the ACMCrawler collects data from the ACM Digital Library.
